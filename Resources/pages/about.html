    <p>The NashVitality app is your mobile guide to a healthy, active and green lifestyle in Nashville, Tennessee. Inside this app you will find interactive maps for all types of activities including walking, hiking, biking, water access, and much more.

Every screen has the “Explore Near Me” option which when clicked will display areas to be active and green near you. </p>

    <p>NashVitality is an initiative of Metro Public Health Department’s Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW) campaign, funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009.</p>
    
    <p>The CPPW campaign addresses one of the leading preventable causes of premature death and disability - obesity. CPPW Nashville has worked to create greater access to nutritious foods and safe physical activity through policy, systems and environmental change, where we live, work, learn, worship and play.</p>
