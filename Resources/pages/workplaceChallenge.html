    <p>This is a new city initiative to recognize and encourage places of work in three areas that contribute to a high quality of life: being green, healthy and involved in the community. Participants can sign up for the challenge at <a href="www.mayorsworkplacechallenge.com" onclick="Ti.App.fireEvent('openURL', {url:'http://www.mayorsworkplacechallenge.com'});return false;">www.mayorsworkplacechallenge.com</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Once signed up, you can complete an online scorecard that includes questions about workplace policies and practices as it relates to being green, healthy and promoting volunteerism. Based on a 100-point scale, organizations can achieve bronze, silver or gold status and can continually update their scorecards over the next 12 months to improve their scores. This initiative further Mayor Deanâ€™s efforts to promote and advance the quality of life for Nashville.</p>
