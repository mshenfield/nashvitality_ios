    <p>Walk 100 Miles started in 2011 as a community-wide effort to encourage Nashvillians to improve their overall health by joining their friends and neighbors in walking 100 miles in Nashville’s many parks and greenways. More than 4,000 people signed up for the challenge and collectively walked over 100,000 miles in a three-month period. </p>

<p>This year Mayor Dean is bringing back the highly-popular Walk 100 Miles challenge for a third time, but on an even larger scale – a walking movement called Walk 100 Miles with Nashville. All Nashville residents are invited to create or join a walking group and then motivate each other to complete the 100-mile goal during the summer of 2014. To take the challenge, simply register on-line at <a href="www.walk100miles.com" onclick="Ti.App.fireEvent('openURL', {url:'http://www.walk100miles.com'});return false;">www.walk100miles.com</a>, create or join a walking group (or just walk on your own), then then log and track your mileage.</p>

<p>Use this mobile app to track your mileage then log your walking right on your phone. Just select “Record a Workout” from the app’s home screen to get started. In addition, this app a great mobile tool to find convenient places to walk and take advantage of the interactive maps of trails, greenways and sidewalks throughout Nashville.</p>   

<p>Walk 100 participants are also invited to join the Mayor’s Walking group. Check out the Walk with the Mayor walking calendar or click “News &amp; Events” from the home screen of the NashVitality app.</p>
 
<p>Walk 100 Miles is presented by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee and supported by our partner The Footprint Fund at the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee.</p>
